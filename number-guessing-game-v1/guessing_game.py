Project 1 - The Number Guessing Game
--------------------------------
"""
import random
# Import the random module.
# Create the start_game function.
# Write your code inside this function.

# Create start_game
# Print "Welcome To Maximus Number Hunter"
# Prompt user for name
# set correct_num to random int 1 - 10
# set guess_counter
# set high_scores List
# set guess to 0
# while guess does not equal correct_num
#   Prompt user for guess
#   Catch Possible ValueError
#   Catch Possible TypeError
#       if guess greater than correct_num
#           print its higher
#           guess_counter add
#       elif guess lower than correct_num
#           print its lower
#           guess_counter add
#       else
#           print you got it
#           print it only took guess_counter tries
# print leaderboard
# prompt user to play again?


#   When the program starts, we want to:
#   ------------------------------------
#   1. Display an intro/welcome message to the player.
#   2. Store a random number as the answer/solution.
#   3. Continuously prompt the player for a guess.
#     a. If the guess is greater than the solution, display to the player "It's lower".
#     b. If the guess is less than the solution, display to the player "It's higher".

#   4. Once the guess is correct, stop looping, inform the user they "Got it"
#      and show how many attempts it took them to get the correct number.
#   5. Let the player know the game is ending, or something that indicates the game is over.

# ( You can add more features/enhancements if you'd like to. )


# Kick off the program by calling the start_game function.
